LSParanoid
========

String obfuscator for Android applications.

Usage
-----
In order to make Paranoid work with your project you have to apply the Paranoid Gradle plugin
to the project.

```kotlin
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }

    dependencies {
        classpath("org.lsposed.lsparanoid:gradle-plugin:0.4.2")
        // classpath("com.android.tools.build:gradle")
    }
}

plugins {
    id("org.lsposed.lsparanoid")
    // com.android.application or com.android.library
}
```

Now you can just annotate classes with strings that need to be obfuscated with `@Obfuscate`.
After you project compiles every string in annotated classes will be obfuscated.
Note that this plugin only applies with Android Gradle Plugin. You must either applies
`com.android.application` or `com.android.library` at the mean time.

Configuration
-------------
Paranoid plugin can be configured using `lsparanoid` extension object:
```kotlin
lsparanoid {
  // ...
}

```

The extension object contains the following properties:
- `enabled` — `boolean`. Allows to disable obfuscation for the project. Default value is `true`.
- `includeDependencies` — `boolean`. Allows to enable obfuscation for subprojects. Default value is `false`. You can only set it to `true`
  when `com.android.application` is to appiled.
- `seed` - `Integer`. A seed that can be used to make obfuscation stable across builds. Default value is `null`, which means that the seed
  is computed from input files on each build.
- `global` - `boolean`. If `true`, the obfuscation will be applied to all classes, not only annotated ones. Default value is `false`.
- `variantFilter` - `(Variant) -> boolean`. Allows to filter out variants that should be obfuscated. Default value always returns `true`.

How it works
------------
Let's say you have an `Activity` that contains some string you want to be obfuscated.

```java
@Obfuscate
public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
  private static final String QUESTION = "Q: %s";
  private static final String ANSWER = "A: %s";

  @Override
  protected void onCreate(final Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.main_activity);

    final TextView questionTextView = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.questionTextView);
    questionTextView.setText(String.format(QUESTION, "Does it work?"));

    final TextView answerTextView = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.answerTextView);
    answerTextView.setText(String.format(ANSWER, "Sure it does!"));
  }
}
```

The class contains both string constants (`QUESTION` and `ANSWER`) and string literals.
After compilation this class will be transformed to something like this.

```java

@Obfuscate
public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
  private static final String QUESTION = Deobfuscator.getString(4);
  private static final String ANSWER = Deobfuscator.getString(5);

  protected void onCreate(final Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.main_activity);

    final TextView questionTextView = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.questionTextView);
    questionTextView.setText(String.format(Deobfuscator.getString(0), Deobfuscator.getString(1)));

    final TextView answerTextView = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.answerTextView);
    answerTextView.setText(String.format(Deobfuscator.getString(2), Deobfuscator.getString(3)));
  }
}

```
